An Android app made for a Mobile Application Development class at NSCC. This app is features a list of trailers to play. When clicking on a trailer to view, the trailer is displayed (from YouTube) along with a rating bar, the title and a description. Any trailer can be deleted if wanted. Trailers can be added by entering its YouTube video id. The viewing of trailers used to work but does not anymore due to an outdated api. However the video thumbnails still show up for the trailer, which are grabbed automatically when a trailer is added.
